![Learning Path](https://img.shields.io/badge/Learning%20Path-OPS-fe5e00?logo=microsoft)  ![Session](https://img.shields.io/badge/üó£Ô∏èSessions-5-31c754)

Welcome!

The content of this repository is available for you so you can reproduce any demo or learn how to present any session of the Learning Path presented at [Migrosoft Ignite](https://www.microsoft.com/ignite) and during [Microsoft Ignite The Tour](https://www.microsoft.com/ignite-the-tour/), in your local field office, a community user group, or even as a lunch-and-learn event for your company.

## Do the Demos

If you are here to reproduce a demo in the comfort of your home/office, go in in the section [Sessions](#sessions). In each session you will find deployment instructions, to create the environment you need, and a tutorial to do the demo step by step.

## Presenting the content

We're glad you are here and look forward to your delivery of this amazing content. As an experienced presenter, we know you know HOW to present so this guide will focus on WHAT you need to present. It will provide you a full run-through of the presentation created by the presentation design team.

Along with the video of the presentation, this repository will link to all the assets you need to successfully present including PowerPoint slides and demo instructions & code.

## Sessions

Here all the sessions available in the learning path **Improving Your Reliability through Modern Operations Practices** (aka: **OPS**)

## [OPS10: Building the Foundation for Modern Ops: Monitoring](/ops10/README.md)

You are concerned about the reliability of your systems, services, and products. Where should you start?

In this session, you‚Äôll get an introduction to modern operations disciplines and a framework for reliability work. We jump into monitoring: the foundational practice you must tackle before you can make any headway with reliability. Using Tailwind Traders as an example, we‚Äôll demonstrate how to monitor your environment, including the right (and wrong) things to monitor ‚Äì and why. You‚Äôll leave with the crucial tools and knowledge you need to discuss and improve reliability using objective data.

## [OPS20: Responding to Incidents](/ops20/README.md)

Your systems are down!

Customers are calling. Every moment counts.

What do you do?

Handling incidents well is core to meeting your reliability goals.

In this session, we‚Äôll explore incident management best practices that will help you triage, remediate, and communicate as effectively as possible.

We‚Äôll also explore the tools Azure provides to get you back into a working state when time is of the essence.

## [OPS30: Learning from Failure](/ops30/README.md)

Incidents will happen‚Äîthere‚Äôs no doubt about that. The key question is whether you will treat them as a learning opportunity to make your operations practice better or just as a loss of time, money, and reputation.

In this session, you‚Äôll dive into one of the most important topics for improving reliability: how to learn from failure. We‚Äôll listen in on one of Tailwind Traders post-incident reviews, often called a postmortem so we can see how it is done. You‚Äôll learn how to shape and run this process so it actually yields value from something that would ordinarily be just a failure. After this session, you‚Äôll be able to build a key feedback loop in your organization that turns unplanned outages into opportunities

## [OPS40: Deployment Practices for Greater Reliability](/ops40/README.md)

Infrastructure and software delivery methods have a direct and material impact on reliability. Manual service deployment and provisioning is slow, error-prone, and can result in incidents. Using modern continuous deployment practices and provisioning methods can reduce overhead while preventing incidents before they happen.

In this session, we will see how continuous delivery pipelines have helped Tailwind Traders and the rest of the industry deploy tested software to production environments to increase reliability. We‚Äôll also explore modern methods for environment provisioning using infrastructure as code. As a result of attending this session, you will gain practical information on automated deployment and provisioning solutions using Azure-based technology.

## [OPS50: Preparing for Growth: Capacity Planning and Scaling](./ops50)

When your growth or the demand for your systems exceeds, or is projected to exceed, your current capacity ‚Äì that‚Äôs a ‚Äúgood‚Äù problem to have. However, this can be just as much of a threat to your system‚Äôs reliability as any other factor.

In this session, dive into capacity planning and cost estimation basics, including the tools Azure provides to help with both. We wrap up with a discussion and demonstration of how Tailwind Traders judiciously applied Azure scaling features. Learn how to satisfy your customers and a growing demand, even when ‚Äúchallenged‚Äù by success.
